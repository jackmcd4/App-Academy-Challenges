# Write a method that takes in an integer `num` and returns the sum of
# all integers between zero and num, up to and including `num`.
#
# Difficulty: easy.

function sumNums(num){
    var total=0;
    while(num>0){
        total+=num;
        num--;
    }
    return total;
}
sumNums(10)
//returns 55
